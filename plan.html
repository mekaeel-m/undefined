            Wants to show off specifically his previous roblox designs. Needs a simple introduction page for him and what his page is about. Prefers a "contact form/page that sends him an email" that he can view from his inbox.
        </p>

        <h3>Updated Feedback after first Increment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UI/UX Considerations:
            <ul>
                <li>Prefers a purple color scheme</li>
                <li>Wants a cleaner, more focused site that highlights his talents</li>
                <li>Introduction page that catches people</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Functionality:
            <ul>
                <li>3d viewing module that allows visitors to interact with and fully view his 3d designs</li>
                <li>Ability to add and delete roblox thumbmails as he gets more submissions</li>
                <li>Funneling potential client requests to his email through the site</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Our Priority:
            <ul>
                <li>Making a gallery that shows off both his 2d and 3d works, with a highlight on his singular 3d work, although his work is mostly 2d</li>
                <li>Contact page that stores the emails and requests in the database to view at his convenience</li>
                <li>Clean site that reflects on his professionalism as a designer</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unfortunately we were not able to get sending the email through PHP working, so we had to pivot to storing them within the database instead. We still keep all of the same data and information, just changing that it can be viewed in the admin page instead of sending an email to him.<br>
            Otherwise, the client is very happy the site so far, and does not have any other significant changes he wants to make to the site. <br>
            Additionally we have shown him our development plan and a mockup for the final site and is pleased with our plans for the final version. <br>
            Hansen just wanted to reiterate to us the important factors at play for his website and as such with him we created an updated client goals section shown directly above this text.
