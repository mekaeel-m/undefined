        <p class="section-desc">We are making a web app to showcase our client's Roblox projects and animations. These project files, along with some descriptive information about the purpose of the project <s>and possibly some live demo's</s> (Our client said his projects did not have any live demos associated with them). We will then showcase these animations in a clean UI. We will also make an admin page so our client can update the projects he is showcasing. We trying to showcase our client's projects to attract more customers!</p>

            Andrew: Created admin dashboard for Hansen to view the number of current tiles in his gallery. Created an update page where he can view all tiles in a table, then delete or update the tiles. Changed the navbar when logged in, to allow for easy navigation to update and add tiles. Modified other php code to use best practises when getting input parameters. Seperated certain php files into a backend folder. These folders just return json and are fetched with AJAX from the client. This is why I seperated them.<br><br>

        <h3 class="showcase-heading">Client Feedback</h3>

            Wants to show off commission pictures and titles. We can store this on the backend so the client can update what pictures are shown. Wants a hidden admin page where he can add in additional projects when he completes them.
            Wants to show off specifically his previous roblox designs. Needs a simple introduction page for him and what his page is about. Prefers a "contact form/page that sends him an email" that he can view from his inbox.

            Unfortunately we were not able to get sending the email through PHP working, so we had to pivot to storing them within the database instead. We still keep all of the same data and information, just changing that it can be viewed in the admin page instead of sending an email to him.<br>
            Otherwise, the client is very happy the site so far, and does not have any other significant changes he wants to make to the site. <br>
=======
            <br>
            The clients requested changes are above. Anything with strikethrough is what we have updated since the initial plan. <br>

            Additionally we have shown him our development plan and a mockup for the final site and is pleased with our plans for the final version. <br>
            Hansen just wanted to reiterate to us the important factors at play for his website and as such with him we created an updated client goals section shown directly above this text.
